# AetherOS

Canonical OS repo consolidating:
- `MyOS` (legacy kernel + subsystems)
- `Aether_OS` (local project docs/tooling)

Status: bootstrap + migration in progress.

## Layout (initial)
- `legacy/` — imported projects with preserved history (first: `legacy/MyOS/`)
- `docs/aether_os/` — imported design docs from the local Aether_OS project
- `tools/` — build/migration scripts

See `MIGRATION.md` for the plan.
